# Responsive-Portfolio
For this project we were asked to create three HTML pages with working links. I was successfully able to do so wich made the pages connect and the links active.

## Responsive Solutions
When viewing my site while in the different sizes ex. sm md lg xl the photos are responsive and fluid throughout the transitions.

The bootsrap grid system made everything that much easier


My navbar has some style from css but the main structure was pulled fron bootstrap. Included on the navbar are the required links, home contact and portfolio.

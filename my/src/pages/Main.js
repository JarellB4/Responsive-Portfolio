    <p> My name is Jarell Kevin Boone and I have aspirations to become a web developer. Im continuing my
    education
    to not only create a better future for my family, but also to hopefully create one for those around
    me. The thing I enjoy doing
    the most is helping people. Ultimately, anyhing that I do in the web development field, I would like
    for it to be associated with purpose and helping people reach their potential. My hobbies are slowly
    turning into programming daily, however I use to enjoy playing basketball as often as I could.
    Maybe one day I will have enough time to enjoy them both.
